I am trying to create a classic arcade style space game where your player (ship) is destroying asteroids in space (obviously) and the goal is to get the highest score possible.
Of course, it's very likely that this project never gets completed, since it's just meant as a learning project (my first one in fact) and I might have trouble bringing it to completion despite how small it is.
